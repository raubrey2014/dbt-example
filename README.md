## DBT Demo

This project is a demo of dbt, specifically catered to test a few use cases beyond the intro tutorial:

1. DBT project nested in a subfolder of a broader project (hence the analytics/ folder, meant to simulate being part of a broader monorepo)
2. Git ci flow - deploy main and production branches to different targets

### Git flow

Heavily influenced by [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-dbt-to-production-using-github-action-778bf6a1dff6).
